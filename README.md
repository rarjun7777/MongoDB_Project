# MongoDB-Based Authentication System

This project is a robust authentication system built using MongoDB as the database. It provides user registration, login, session management, and authentication middleware.

## Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- User Logout
- Session Management
- Authentication Middleware
- Error Handling
- Testing
- Security Best Practices

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- A `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (See [Configuration](#configuration))

#  Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-authentication-system.git

2. Now, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv

3. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Configuration
   
Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure the following environment variables:

# MongoDB connection

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=3000

#

Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name with your actual MongoDB connection URI and your-secret-key with a strong JWT secret key.

Usage
API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available:

POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Log in using email and password.
POST /logout: Log out and invalidate the session token.
GET /profile: Get the user's profile (protected route).
POST /refresh: Refresh the session token.

#

Authentication Middleware
Protected routes can be accessed by users with a valid session token. Middleware is used to authenticate API requests.

Testing
To run unit and integration tests, use the following command:
  
npm test

#

Security Considerations
Passwords are securely hashed before storage.
JWT secrets and sensitive data should be stored securely (e.g., environment variables).
Implement session management to handle token expiration.
Protect against common security threats (e.g., MongoDB injection, brute force attacks).
